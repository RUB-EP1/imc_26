## Abstract
As part of the International Masterclasses programme, the new LHCb group at Ruhr University Bochum offers the opportunity on 26 February to learn about the research methods of particle physics and our detector. Interested students from grade 10 onward are invited to dive into particle physics. After an introduction to particle physics and particle detectors, students will analyze data from the LHCb detector at CERN themselves. The day concludes with a video conference with CERN and student groups from other countries. We also offer a virtual visit to the LHCb detector!
